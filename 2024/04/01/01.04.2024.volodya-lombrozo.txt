Subject: WEEK 14 JavaDataflow

Hi all,

Last week achievements:
jeo-maven-plugin:
- Fixed bugs with incorrect disassembly and assembly of annotations instructions [#531]
- Extended annotations support by enhancing annotation handling and testing [#488]
- Fixed the bug of incorrect invocation parameters by updating bytecode handling in Java classes and test files [#488]
- Implemented disassembling and assembling of bytecode versions for each class [#488]
- Disabled automatic frames computation to avoid missing classes at build time [#524]
- Implemented max stack and max locals disassembly/assembly to specify sizes for methods [#488]

Next week plans:
jeo-maven-plugin:
- Check default values for annotation properties in AnnotationsApplication.java to resolve processing issues [#534]
- Refactor Annotations Implementation in BytecodeAnnotation.java for simplification and readability [#532]
- Investigate and fix the issue of automatic frame computation in CustomClassWriter to prevent test failures [#528]
- Enable 'eo-to-bytecode' integration test in pom.xml by addressing backward compatibility issues [#526]
- Refactor DataType, HexData, and HexString classes for clearer responsibilities [#520]
- Enable the execution of the `xmir-to-phi` goal in pom.xml after resolving existing bugs [#506]
- Use AllLabels properly in Disassemble.java to optimize performance and avoid cache clearing [#501]
- Enable 'spring-fat' Integration Test in pom.xml by adding support for various Java features [#488]

Risks:
- <todo>

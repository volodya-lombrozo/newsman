  <p>From: Vladimir Zakharov
Subject: WEEK 15 Objectionary

Hi all,

Last week achievements:
jeo-maven-plugin:
- Updated Docker image to `lombrozo/rultor-image-java:pr-3` in `.rultor.yml` [#chore]
- Improved code readability by updating dependencies and preventing `NullPointerExceptions` in string comparisons [#199]
- Enabled 'eo-to-bytecode' integration test and updated README with test information [#526]
- Refactored bytecode generation by introducing `CustomClassWriter` and improving method writing logic [#528]
- Added support for annotation default values, refactored code, and updated coverage ratios [#534]
opeo-maven-plugin:
- Enabled full 'spring-fat' integration test and provided detailed instructions for running the test suite [#488]

Next week plans:
jeo-maven-plugin:
- To incorporate a large integration test for the `opeo-maven-plugin` mimicking a realistic scenario [#200]
- To apply XSL transformations for XMIR to bytecode conversion instead of manual parsing [#549]
- To enhance the `spring-fat` integration test by adding HTTP support for a more realistic scenario [#548]
- To replace `org.w3c.dom` usages with `com.jcabi.xml` for improved XML parsing [#546]
- To enable bytecode verification for the Spring Fat integration test [#543]
- To remove ad-hoc solutions for method frames computation in `CustomClassWriter.java` [#540]
- To refactor the `DirectivesMethod` class for improved code readability [#537]
- To refactor the `DirectivesAnnotationVisitor` class to reduce complexity and remove null values [#536]
- To refactor the annotations implementation for simplification and readability [#532]
- To refactor the `DataType`, `HexData`, and `HexString` classes for clearer responsibilities [#520]
- To enable the execution of the `xmir-to-phi` goal after fixing a bug [#506]
- To use `AllLabels` properly in `Disassemble.java` to avoid cache clearing [#501]

Risks:
- <todo>

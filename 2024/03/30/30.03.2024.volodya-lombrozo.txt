Subject: WEEK 13 JavaDataflow

Hi all,

Last week achievements:
jeo-maven-plugin:
- Fixed bugs with incorrect disassembly and assembly of annotations instructions [#531]
- Extended annotations support by enhancing annotation handling and testing [#488]
- Fixed the bug of incorrect invocation parameters by updating bytecode handling in Java classes [#488]
- Implemented disassembling and assembling of bytecode versions for each class [#488]
- Disabled automatic frames computation to avoid missing classes at build time [#524]
- Implemented support for max stack and max locals method attributes [#488]

Next week plans:
jeo-maven-plugin:
- Check default values in AnnotationsApplication.java to resolve puzzle [#534], BytecodeAnnotation.java to refactor annotations [#532], CustomClassWriter.java to disable automatic frame computation [#528], DataType.java to refactor data types [#520], pom.xml to enable 'eo-to-bytecode' integration [#526], enable 'xmir-to-phi' execution in pom.xml [#506], use AllLabels properly in Disassemble.java to avoid issues [#501], and enable 'spring-fat' integration test in pom.xml [#488].

Risks:
- <todo>
